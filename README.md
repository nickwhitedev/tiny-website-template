# Tiny Website Template
Use this website template to get started in building your own website.

It's a minimal setup for building a site. Just a home page with a title, quick blurb, and some links with a copyright statement and starter CSS.

There are no dependencies. There is no javascript but it is set up with an index.js file in case you feel like adding some.

Inspiration was drawn from [Plain Vanilla](https://plainvanillaweb.com) and [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org).
